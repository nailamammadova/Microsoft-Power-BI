# PowerBI-Projects
This repository contains all of my projects created in MS PowerBI. 
The dashboard labeled "Data Analytics - Survey Result Dashboard" in this file breaks down raw survey data to provide insights. It helps to understand the survey participants' work/life balance, average salary by gender, satisfaction with their current position, average salary across different industries, and favorite programming languages.
On the other hand, in the file titled "KPMG - Module 3", the sales dashboard dives into a new customer database to offer insights. This is beneficial for the marketing department as it visualizes customer data by gender, profits by brand, and profits based on the wealth segment of new customers, among other things.
